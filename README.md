# TTRPG Encounter Simulator
This is a simple encounter simulator meant to be used **in addition to your good judgment**, not as a replacement for it.

### Feature ideas
1: Ways of contributing to combat different from an attack
* Crowd Control (Reduce enemy damage. But how to quantify?)
* Healing (increase ally HP. But how to limit the number of uses?)
* "Programmable" behaviors like "if ally is at 0 HP, heal, else crowd control" => might be too complex to input easily

2: Streamlined input
* Advanced search which pulls up the stats of a monster in particular (database entry is going to be super difficult for hundreds of monsters)
* Save/Load encounters in your session
* Bigger/easier to click +/- buttons for the creature count

3: More complex input
* A DPR calculator form, which asks you things like how many attacks you make, whether your spell is AoE, etc... And calculates your DPR for you using "common sense" rules
* Adventuring day: a "add encounter" button under the simulation, which adds another simulation. The PCs' hit points are saved between encounters.

3: Other
* RGPD opt-in cookie thingy
